// clientReminderWorker - delivers the operator-configured "Client Reminders"
// to a client's payment email and/or their Mattermost channel.
//
// One ClientReminderConfig document per client (Schema_Models/ClientReminderConfig.js),
// one row per catalogue item (Utils/reminderItems.js). Every five minutes this
// worker walks the configs that have at least one enabled item with at least
// one enabled channel, asks the pure scheduling functions below whether each
// row is due, and hands the due ones to deliverReminder().
//
// THE PRODUCT RULE that shapes everything here: an activity-gated report with
// nothing to report is NOT sent. Zero jobs added and zero applications means
// the client hears nothing. Silence beats an empty digest, and decideDelivery()
// is the single place that decision lives.
//
// Design notes worth reading before changing anything:
//
//   • periodKeyFor / reportWindowFor / isItemDue / decideDelivery are PURE.
//     No Mongo, no process.env, no ambient clock - `now` is always an argument.
//     The whole test suite leans on that, and so does the preview route, which
//     needs to show an operator exactly what a given item would render without
//     touching delivery state.
//
//   • Idempotency is by PERIOD KEY, never by timestamp. An item sends when its
//     computed period key differs from the stored lastPeriodKey. See the long
//     comment on persistOutcome() for why a SKIP writes the key too.
//
//   • MISSED WINDOWS DIE QUIETLY. If the process was down over a scheduled
//     time and the period has since rolled over, that period is simply never
//     delivered - the new period computes a different key and the old one is
//     forgotten. This is deliberate. Do not "fix" it into a catch-up queue:
//     coming back from a two-day outage would fire two days of digests at once,
//     and a stale Monday report landing on Wednesday is worse than no report.
//
//   • Nothing in this file throws to its caller. Not the tick, not a delivery,
//     not a persistence failure. A notification path that can crash the process
//     it runs inside is a notification path that gets deleted.
