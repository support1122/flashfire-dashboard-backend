// AiUsageDaily — REAL token usage, rolled up per (IST day, source, model).
//
// Why this exists
// ---------------
// Every LLM call in this backend already gets exact token counts back from the
// provider (`usage` on OpenAI, `usageMetadata` on Vertex) and every single call
// site was THROWING THEM AWAY. The Discord scrape-milestone embed therefore
// priced the day from hardcoded per-batch guesses, which measured ~2x under the
// real OpenAI bill. This collection is the fix: providers report, we record,
// the reports read measured numbers instead of guessing.
//
// Shape: a daily ROLLUP, not a row per call. One `$inc` upsert per LLM call
// against a doc keyed (day, source, model) — so a day of traffic is a handful
// of documents rather than thousands, and "what did today cost" is one cheap
// find() instead of an aggregation over a growing log.
//
// `source` is the pipeline that spent the money, which is the thing nobody
// could see before: judging, second-stage screening, resume summaries, and
// recruiter templates all landed in one undifferentiated OpenAI invoice.
