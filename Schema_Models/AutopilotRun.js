// One document per finished Flashfire Autopilot run, for one client.
//
// The autopilot already knew all of this - it just printed it to a terminal on
// a VPS nobody watches. Persisting it is what lets the Client Tracking portal
// answer "how did last night's scrape go for this client" without anyone
// SSHing anywhere.
//
// The three numbers ops actually asks for:
//   captured - job cards the extension pulled off JobRight (panel "#count")
//   pushed   - of those, how many reached the client's dashboard
//   rejected - captured minus pushed: AI skips, duplicates, blocked and errors
//              rolled together. The breakdown lives in dupes/blocked/errors.
//
// captured is stored under its own name rather than "total" because "total" in
// a report table reads as "total jobs", which it is not.
//
// outcome is the machine key ("list-exhausted"); outcomeLabel and why are the
// plain-English pair the autopilot already computes in describe_outcome(), and
// severity ("good"/"warn"/"bad") is what drives the colour in the UI. Storing
// all three means the portal never has to re-implement that mapping and the
// two surfaces can never drift apart.
