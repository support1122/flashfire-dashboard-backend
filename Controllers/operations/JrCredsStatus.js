// Do two hand-typed names refer to the same person?
//
// Both sides are free text typed by different people into different systems,
// and the live data shows every way that goes wrong: DashboardTracking carries
// "Sarah" on 107 clients and "Sarah " - trailing space - on another 47, the
// Operations collection has "sushmitha" in lowercase, and a lead field is
// sometimes run together with something else, as in "sarahali".
//
// So: strip everything that is not a letter, fold the case, and compare the
// first NAME_MATCH_CHARS letters. That accepts "Sarah" == "Sarah " ==
// "sarahali" == "Sarah K." while still keeping the real names apart - the two
// managers in service, Sarah and Sonali, differ at the third letter, and no
// operator name is a prefix of another (asserted in the tests).
//
// The min() matters for short names: "asif" is four letters, so comparing a
// fixed five would never match it against itself. Below three letters there is
// not enough to be confident, so it is not a match at all - better to show the
// prompt to nobody than to the wrong manager.

// POST /operations/jr-creds-status   body: { operatorEmail, clientEmail }
//
// Answers one question for the dashboard: does this client still need their
// JobRight login saved before the autopilot can work them unattended?
//
// WHY THE SERVER DECIDES, AND NOT THE BROWSER
// The operator "session" in this app lives in a zustand store persisted to
// localStorage, so `role === "operations"` is a value the person at the
// keyboard can type in their own devtools. A client who did that would see any
// operator-only UI that trusts it. So this route re-establishes the identity
// against the database on every call, and the prompt renders off THIS
// response rather than off local state: a client gets 403, receives no
// payload, and therefore has nothing to render. The password likewise only
// exists in the response - it is never a constant in the bundle.
//
// The check is deliberately two-sided:
//   1. operatorEmail must be a real Operations document. That collection only
//      accepts @flashfirehq addresses (see its schema), so a client address
//      can never match.
//   2. that operator must actually manage this client. Without this, one
//      known operator address would unlock every client on the platform.
//      Admins skip it, because they legitimately work across all clients.
