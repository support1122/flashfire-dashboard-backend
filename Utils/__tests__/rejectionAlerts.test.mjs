// Rejections: detect them, record them, tell nobody.
//
// The rules classifier flags rejection mail and the digest stores the verdict,
// so the data is queryable. Nothing is delivered off the back of it:
//
//   • NO Discord line. Ops asked for that to stop (28 Sept 2026); a steady
//     trickle of bad news is not what the mail channel is for.
//   • NO client email, ever. Telling somebody by robot that they were turned
//     down is not a thing this product does.
//
// The AI check still runs, for one reason only: when it catches a false
// positive it has the regex learner write an exclusion, which is what keeps the
// rejection patterns sharpening. That loop is the whole remaining point.
//
// Pure functions and source checks. No Mongo, no OpenAI, nothing sent.
