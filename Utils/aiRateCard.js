// aiRateCard — the ONE place model pricing lives.
//
// Every cost number the backend shows (the Discord scrape-milestone embed, the
// "Daily AI cost" tile on the AI Summaries page) prices tokens through this
// table. Previously each of those had its own hardcoded rates, so they drifted.
//
// Rates are USD per 1M tokens. `cachedIn` is what OpenAI bills for a prompt-cache
// HIT — for the 4o family that is 50% of the input rate, so it is written out
// explicitly rather than derived, because that ratio is NOT universal across
// models and a future model with a different discount would silently mis-price.
//
// Source: https://openai.com/api/pricing/ and https://ai.google.dev/pricing
// Update `asOf` whenever you touch a number — the UI surfaces it so ops can see
// how stale the card is.
